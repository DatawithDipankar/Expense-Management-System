## üóÉÔ∏è MySQL Database Setup

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure you have MySQL installed and running

### A. Create database and table

You can do this via terminal or MySQL Workbench:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE expense_manager;

USE expense_manager;

CREATE TABLE expenses (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    expense_date DATE NOT NULL,
    amount FLOAT NOT NULL,
    category VARCHAR(255),
    notes TEXT
);
```

### B. Configure connection

Edit the connection in `backend/db_helper.py`:

```python
connection = mysql.connector.connect(
    host="localhost",
    user="root",
    password="your_password",
    database="expense_manager"
)
```

## üîê Password Protection

This app is protected by a login screen.

### Set the password in `.env`:

```
APP_PASSWORD=mysecret123
```

You‚Äôll be prompted to enter this when you open the Streamlit app.
